## Overview

This project is a Solidity library designed to provide utility functions and helper contracts for a crypto payment solution implemented in another private repository (for www.imagella.com). The library is continuously developed and documented with NatSpec comments to ensure clear, self-explanatory code.

## Features

- **Utility Contracts:** Provides functions for token management, string operations, and custom error handling.
- **NatSpec Documentation:** Every function and contract includes NatSpec comments for clear documentation.
- **TypeScript Integration:** Supporting scripts for deployment and testing are written in TypeScript.
- **Hardhat Environment:** Uses Hardhat for compiling, testing, and deploying contracts.
- **Cross-Platform Development:** Developed on Linux Ubuntu with a Node.js environment.
